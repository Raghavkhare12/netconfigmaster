# NetConfigMaster - Professional Project Summary

## Overview
NetConfigMaster is a professionally structured machine learning project that translates natural language network configuration requests into Nmstate YAML specifications using transformer models.

## Project Reorganization Complete ✅

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Directory Structure Reorganization**
   - Moved from flat "model training/" structure to professional hierarchy
   - Created standard directories: `src/`, `data/`, `metrics/`, `docs/`, `tests/`
   - Added proper Python package structure with `__init__.py` files

2. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - ✅ Main README.md updated with new structure
   - ✅ Individual README.md files for each major directory
   - ✅ Comprehensive USAGE.md with step-by-step instructions
   - ✅ Detailed ARCHITECTURE.md with system design diagrams
   - ✅ Professional docstrings in key Python modules

3. **File Organization**
   - ✅ Moved configuration files to `data/` directory
   - ✅ Moved source code to `src/` directory
   - ✅ Moved metrics to `metrics/` directory
   - ✅ Moved requirements.txt and pylintrc to project root
   - ✅ Created proper directory structure for future growth

4. **Professional Standards Applied**
   - Clear separation of concerns (data, code, metrics, docs, tests)
   - Comprehensive documentation at multiple levels
   - Proper Python package structure
   - Standardized naming conventions
   - Professional README with quick start guide
